For this design document, I’ve come up with 3 cards, an enemy card, and a relic card that I will be working on for future assignments. The 3 cards I wanted to make cover each rarity, but primarily focus on attack. I want to contribute to the players experience in dealing damage, I never liked defense anyway. 
I referenced the Wikipedia for Slay The Spire to setup my layout for each of these cards.
